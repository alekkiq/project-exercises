# Orientation Module 1.1 Writing tasks

## Task 1

### Assignment
> Think of everyday situations that simulation could analyze. What aspects of the situation make the simulation approach specifically appropriate for analyzing the situation (i.e., think about and explain why simulation would be specifically better than experimenting in the real world). What aspects of sustainability can you incorporate into the simulation

### Answer
Simulation could theoretically analyze any real-world situation that involves some sort of system, process etc. that may change over time. What determines whether simulation is a viable choice, depends on whether the system or process to be simulated is too complex, dangerous, expensive or just time-consuming to be experimented in real life. This includes more mundane things like the spreading of a disease, or a city's traffic flow during rush-hour, but also more complex things like the climate change or perhaps the durability of a given material under extreme conditions, let's say in a space shuttle or a larger construction.

Simulation also provides a good "entry point" for the sustainability aspect of testing a certain system, as it allows for testing scenarios with minimal carbon emissions. For example, if simulating something to do with transportation or vehicles in general, computer simulations cause far less carbon emissions than their real-world counterparts. This is even further the case, when simulating/analyzing larger systems of the aforementioned topics.

## Task 2

### Assignment
> Take a real-world operational system that can be observed (bank, supermarket) and identify the elements associated with it in terms of variability, complexity, interconnectedness

### Answer

Let's take a supermarket as an example. Firstly, variability. Most of it has got to do with the varying amount of customers at the market. When the amount of customers varies, so does the amount of products being sold, the amount of workforce (cashiers, restockers etc.) needed, queue waiting times and so on. Another aspect of variability is definitely the amount of products at the store. The amount of a certain product could vary due to seasonal/trending products etc. This then can also affect the customer flow, and the rabbit hole goes on and on. A supermarkets complexity is also high, as there is a lot of different products available, customers with their own needs as well as workers who have their own set tasks to do. Interconnectedness is also a large factor, as all the previously mentioned components (products, customers, workers etc.) are all interconnected and affect each other in one way or another. For example, a customer might want a certain product, which might be out of stock -> a worker then has to restock it -> the customer might then have to wait in a longer queue -> other customers could get frustrated and leave the store without buying anything etc.
