# Orientation Module 1.2 Writing tasks

## Task 1

### Assignment
> a) Why does an arrival event need to generate a new arrival event? b) Which event should be generated by the start of the service (of a single service point)?

### Answer
a)

An arrival event needs to generate a new arrival event in order to simulate the continuous flow of clients or customers into the system/process. In real-world scenarios, arrivals are not one time occurrences but happen repeatedly over time. By generating a new arrival event after each arrival, the simulation can accurately model the workings of the system and capture how clients arrive, wait in queue, and are finally served.

b)

When a service starts, it must also schedule its completion event. This is the point when the service will be finished, and the client will exit the service point, at which point the next client can begin their service.

## Task 4

### Assignment
> Continue with the three-phase simulation example (section Telephone call centre example: hand simulation) until one client of client type Y exits the system. Return your solution as an attachment to the solution of this exercise.
